# Baseball-performance-metrics-and-Salary-analysis
For this analysis, I explored baseball data and metrics for hitting and pitching such as Runs Batted In (RBI) and Earned Run Average (ERA). 
In particular, I was interested in the relationship or lack there of between various performance metrics for batting and pitching and player salaries.
I wanted to determine which batting and pitching stats were most strongly correlated with salaries and why that might be so. However, 
I wanted to go further and examine a playerâ€™s change in performance metrics over seasons and how that may be related to the salary he earned. 
Therefore, the approach I took was to examine a single season of salaries, from 2008, and look at the hitting and pitching data from not only that year, 
but from the preceding two seasons (2006, 2007) and the following two seasons (2009, 2010). 

I had several questions about the data that I would seek to answer:

1.Which batting statistic, hits, home runs, or runs batted in, had the highest correlation with player salary?

2.Which pitching statistic, earned run average, wins, or strikeouts, had the highest correlation with pitcher salary?
